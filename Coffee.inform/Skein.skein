The shrill beep of the alarm clock wakes you up from a beautiful dream you can only vaguely remember. You barely manage to hit the button to switch the alarm off, groaning. You are extremely tired. You knew you had to pay the price when you went to bed that late yesterday evening, and you also knew that you had to get up early today because there is a lot of work to do. You still need to finish a number of things and the deadline is this evening.

Well, anyway. You will be working from home today and all you have to do is getting to your desk in your home office room and start being productive.

Bedroom (on the bed)
Your bedroom is barely big enough for the bed and a small closet. The air is a bit stuffy in here. Through a small window in the north wall you can see that it&apos;s still dark outside, which is to be expected at this early hour. The only exit is south to the living room.

You crawl halfway under the bed and pull the power supply by the cable. Something is seriously wrong with it. The power cord (which is supposed to connect the unit to the wall outlet) has been ripped in two. The power plug is missing completely. Looks like the dog of your neighbour had some fun with it the last time you watched (or rather, failed to watch) after it, two days ago. It must have used the power supply as a sort of toy when you were inattentive, leaving it under the bed in the end. Luckily, the power supply unit itself and the cable that would connect to your laptop look undamaged.

You fumble and and twiddle with the stranded wires but finally manage to connect each of the wires from the power plug to the corresponding wire of the broken power cord of the power supply. Lacking proper tools for the job you just twist them together but it seems to hold well enough for now, if you handle it carefully. Luckily, each wire still has a bit of colored insulation so it&apos;s easy to figure out which connections need to be made.

    <result xml:space="preserve">Kitchen
The kitchen is very narrow, though quite long. Lined up at the left side is the fridge, the kitchen counter, the sink, the oven and a cupboard. A rather large coffee machine and a toaster nearly fill the small kitchen counter. Behind them you can see a wall outlet. A tiny kitchen table with two chairs is at the north end.

The only exit is west, to the living room.

On the kitchen table is a pack of toast (in which are nine untoasted pieces of toast).

It had been charred black even before you put it in the toaster. It seems toasting it again did not make much of a difference - except that there is an unpleasent burnt smell in the kitchen now.

The kitchen is very narrow, though quite long. Lined up at the left side is the fridge, the kitchen counter, the sink, the oven and a cupboard. A rather large coffee machine and a toaster nearly fill the small kitchen counter. Behind them you can see a wall outlet. A tiny kitchen table with two chairs is at the north end.

The only exit is west, to the living room.

On the kitchen table is a pack of toast (in which are six untoasted pieces of toast).

You can also see a charred piece of toast here.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You fetch the laptop from the table. You spend yesterday evening and a good part of the night slouching about on the sofa, watching TV without paying attention and at the same time surfing the internet. You don&apos;t even remember exactly what pages in particular you were reading, probably meaningless nonsense, as usual. You did so until the battery was sucked empty. Being too lazy to search for the power supply, you finally went to bed. If only you could remember where you put the power supply.

The kitchen is very narrow, though quite long. Lined up at the left side is the fridge, the kitchen counter, the sink, the oven and a cupboard. A rather large coffee machine and a toaster nearly fill the small kitchen counter. Behind them you can see a wall outlet. A tiny kitchen table with two chairs is at the north end.

The only exit is west, to the living room.

On the kitchen table is a pack of toast (closed) (in which are ten untoasted pieces of toast).

    <result xml:space="preserve">(the power supply)
You crawl halfway under the bed and pull the power supply by the cable. Something is seriously wrong with it. The power cord (which is supposed to connect the unit to the wall outlet) has been ripped in two. The power plug is missing completely. Looks like the dog of your neighbour had some fun with it the last time you watched (or rather, failed to watch) after it, two days ago. It must have used the power supply as a sort of toy when you were inattentive, leaving it under the bed in the end. Luckily, the power supply unit itself and the cable that would connect to your laptop look undamaged.

You fumble and and twiddle with the stranded wires but finally manage to connect each of the wires from the power plug to the corresponding wire of the broken power cord of the power supply. Lacking proper tools for the job you just twist them together but it seems to hold well enough for now, if you handle it carefully. Luckily, each wire still has a bit of colored insulation so it&apos;s easy to figure out which connections need to be made.

A quite expensive bean-to-cup coffee brewer. It is probably also capable of making all sorts of coffee specialties like Cappuccino, Espresso, Latte Macchiato, Ristretto and what not. You never got around to read that part in the manual, though. That&apos;s why you just stuck with making plain coffee with it. There is a single button on the front. It is labelled with a stylized cup of coffee. The coffee machine also has a power cord with a power plug.

The display is unlit.

It is not plugged into anything.

The living room of your tiny, over-priced flat. As untidy as usual. Large windows open to the south and provide a nice view of the city (or would, if it weren&apos;t still dark outside). A door to the north leads back to the bedroom. To the west is the hallway and the kitchen is to the east.

There is a low table in front of the sofa.

On the low table is a laptop.

Crammed into one corner is an old floor lamp.

The kitchen is very narrow, though quite long. Lined up at the left side is the fridge, the kitchen counter, the sink, the oven and a cupboard. A rather large coffee machine and a toaster nearly fill the small kitchen counter. Behind them you can see a wall outlet. A tiny kitchen table with two chairs is at the north end.

The only exit is west, to the living room.

On the kitchen table is a pack of toast (closed) (in which are ten untoasted pieces of toast).

The power cord (which is supposed to connect the unit to the wall outlet) has been ripped in two. The power plug is missing completely. Looks like the dog of your neighbour had some fun with it the last time you watched (or rather, failed to watch) after it, two days ago. It must have used the power supply as a sort of toy when you were inattentive, leaving it under the bed in the end.

There is a low table in front of the sofa.

On the low table is a laptop.

Crammed into one corner is an old floor lamp.

You can also see a floor lamp&apos;s power plug here.

You fumble and and twiddle with the stranded wires but finally manage to connect each of the wires from the power plug to the corresponding wire of the broken power cord of the power supply. Lacking proper tools for the job you just twist them together but it seems to hold well enough for now, if you handle it carefully. Luckily, each wire still has a bit of colored insulation so it&apos;s easy to figure out which connections need to be made.

    <result xml:space="preserve">(the power supply)
You fumble and and twiddle with the stranded wires but finally manage to connect each of the wires from the power plug to the corresponding wire of the broken power cord of the power supply. Lacking proper tools for the job you just twist them together but it seems to hold well enough for now, if you handle it carefully. Luckily, each wire still has a bit of colored insulation so it&apos;s easy to figure out which connections need to be made.
