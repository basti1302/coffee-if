Section Water Handling

The cup is a thing.
The cup is either empty or full-of-coffee or full-of-water.
Understand "coffee" as cup when the cup is full-of-coffee.
Understand "water" as cup when the cup is full-of-water.
The cup is empty.

The description of the cup is "The cup you usually use for your morning coffee[if the cup is full-of-coffee]. There is some steaming black coffee in it[otherwise if the cup is full-of-water]. There is some water in it[otherwise]. To your disappointment, it is empty[end if]."
The printed name of the cup is "[if the cup is full-of-coffee]cup of coffee[otherwise if the cup is full-of-water]cup with water[otherwise]cup[end if]"

The watertank is part of the coffee machine. 

The watertank has a number called the capacity. The capacity of the watertank is 15.
The watertank has a number called the fill-level. The fill-level of the watertank is 0.
To decide if the watertank is empty:
	if the fill-level of the watertank is 0:
		decide yes;
	decide no.
To decide if the watertank is full:
	if the fill-level of the watertank >= the capacity of the watertank:
		decide yes;
	decide no.

The description of the watertank is "[if watertank is full]The watertank is full[otherwise if the watertank is empty]The watertank is empty[otherwise]There is some water in the watertank, the water level reaches up to a line labelled [the fill-level of the watertank][end if]."

Instead of inserting something into the sink:
	if the noun is the watertank:
		if the cup is in the sink:
			say "There is already the cup in the sink. The sink is too small to put both the watertank and the cup into it at the same time.";
		otherwise:
			continue the action;
	otherwise if the noun is the cup:
		if the watertank is in the sink:
			say "There is already the watertank in the sink. The sink is too small to put both the watertank and the cup into it at the same time.";
		otherwise:
			continue the action;
	otherwise:
		say "You would achieve nothing by this."

After switching on the tap:
	if the watertank is in the sink:
		say "The water starts to flow into the watertank. It is full now.";
	otherwise if the cup is in the sink:
		if the cup is full-of-coffee:
			say "The water starts to flow into the cup, replacing the coffee in it. It is full of water now.";
		otherwise:
			say "The water starts to flow into the cup. It is full now.";
	otherwise:
		say "The water starts to flow into the sink."

After inserting the watertank into the sink:
	say "You put the watertank into the sink.";
	if the tap is switched on:
		say "The water from the tap fills the watertank."

After inserting the cup into the sink:
	say "You put the cup into the sink.";
	if the tap is switched on:
		if the cup is full-of-coffee:
			say "The water from the tap fills the cup and replaces the coffee that was in it.";
		otherwise:
			say "The water from the tap fills the cup."

After switching off the tap:
	say "The water stops flowing."

Every turn:
	if the tap is switched on and the watertank is in the sink:
		now the fill-level of the watertank is the capacity of the watertank;
	if the tap is switched on and the cup is in the sink:
		now the cup is full-of-water.

Section Pouring

Emptying it into is an action applying to two things.
understand "empty [something] in/into [something]" as emptying it into.
understand "pour [something] in/into [something]" as emptying it into.
Instead of inserting the cup into the watertank:
	try emptying the cup into the watertank.
Instead of emptying the cup into the coffee machine:
	try emptying the cup into the watertank.

Check emptying something into something:
	if the noun is not the cup:
		say "You cannot empty the [noun] into the [second noun]." instead;
	if the second noun is not the watertank and the second noun is not the sink:
		say "You cannot empty the [noun] into the [second noun]." instead;

	if the second noun is the watertank and the cup is full-of-coffee:
		say "You should not fill coffee into the watertank, it would probably break the machine." instead;
	if the second noun is the watertank and the watertank is full:
		say "The watertank is already full." instead.

Carry out emptying something into something:
	now the cup is empty;
	if the second noun is the watertank:
		increment the fill-level of the watertank.

Report emptying something into something:
	if the second noun is the watertank:

		otherwise unless the watertank is full:
			now the display-text is "'WATERTANK EMPTY'";
		otherwise:
			now the display-text is "'READY'";
	otherwise:

Instead of taking the watertank:
	if the watertank is visible and the watertank is part of the coffee machine:

		say "Taken.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.

Instead of tying the watertank to the coffee machine:
	say "You put the watertank back into the coffee machine.";
	now the watertank is part of the coffee machine.

Instead of pushing the coffee machine's button:
	unless the coffee machine is powered:
		say "You push the button, but nothing happens. You notice that the display is unlit. Obviously the coffee machine has no power.";
	otherwise:
		if the watertank is not part of the coffee machine or the watertank is empty:
			say "The coffee machine emits a low, sad beep.";
		otherwise:
			say "The coffee machine emits a short, happy beep and begins its usual cacaphony off grinding and brewing noises.";
			unless the cup is in the coffee machine:
				say "A little later, a stream of hot, black coffee flows directly into the drip tray, where your cup should have been. It also spills on the kitchen counter. What a mess!";
				now has-made-mess is true;
			otherwise:
				if the cup is full-of-coffee:
					say "A little later, a stream of hot, black coffee flows into the cup, which had been full of coffee already. The coffee starts to flow over as more coffee pours into the cup, spilling all over the kitchen counter. What a mess!";

				otherwise:
					say "A little later, a stream of hot, black coffee flows into the cup. The crema on top just looks delicious.";
					now the cup is full-of-coffee.

[
TODO More stuff for an even more intricate make-coffee-puzzle:

* Add "COF. BEANS EMPTY"?
  - Find pack of beans in cupboard
  - But how to model the bean container? No, just "put beans into coffee machine". OTOH, that really doesn't add any value.
* Alternative way of getting water into the tank?
    - find a cup (on table), put cup in sink, turn on water tap, turn off water tap, get cup, pour water from cup into cm/watertank, do that 3 times

You feel energetic and start to type away, soon completely immersed in your work.";

On the other hand, after the coffee, the urge to lie down and sleep is not so overwhelming anymore[end if]."

The player is on the bed.

After entering the bed:

	say "You crawl halfway under the bed and pull the power supply by the cable. Something is seriously wrong with it. The power cord (which is supposed to connect the unit to the wall outlet) has been ripped in two. The power plug is missing completely. Looks like the dog of your neighbour had some fun with it the last time you watched (or rather, failed to watch) after it, two days ago. It must have used the power supply as a sort of toy when you were inattentive, leaving it under the bed in the end. Luckily, the power supply unit itself and the cable that would connect to your laptop look undamaged.".

Being too lazy to search for the power supply, you finally went to bed[if the power supply is off-stage]. If only you could remember where you put the power supply[otherwise]. At least you have found the power supply by now[end if][if the power supply is on-stage and the power supply is broken], even if it is still broken[end if].";

Unit test (this is the 1 rule):
	try going south;
	try getting off the bed;
	try going west;
	try going south;
	assert that the player is in the hallway.

...even something simple as try going south breaks with the Unit Tests extension - this is quite unusable, I think
